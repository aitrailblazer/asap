## Inspiration
![Inspiration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aitrailblazer/asap/main/img/ASAP-002-copyright.png)
The idea for this app was inspired by GenAI's potential to streamline the time-consuming process of creating and retrieving software code and documentation by integrating sophisticated natural language search and automation capabilities. 

We started this project to automate our own tasks, and it has grown into an incredible solution that we believe will benefit other professionals in the IT community as well. 

With 30 years of experience as a software engineer, I understand firsthand how IT professionals are overwhelmed by endless documentation. They not only struggle with tedious document and code generation tasks but also face significant inefficiencies in retrieving documents. Writing software documentation often took me as much time as developing the solutions, if not more. Moreover, finding and pinpointing the necessary information for a new document within a large database can be daunting. Even for experienced workers, this task can take hours or even days.

The chance to streamline code and documentation creation and integrate GenAI's new natural language search capabilities is a truly inspiring prospect. 

Today, companies store a large variety of documents across multiple systems and databases. Allowing users to input queries in natural language enables more efficient search and retrieval of information. This eliminates the need for users to sift through irrelevant data, saving time and enhancing productivity. 
Moreover, natural language search is versatile across various contexts and industries, allowing users of different experience levels and from different fields to interact with our app in ways that align with their specific needs and vocabularies.

At AITrailblazer, we envision a versatile suite of copilots that automate key parts of the code and documentation creation process, boost productivity, and deliver high-quality, consistent results. Our goal is to enhance operational efficiency and make our sophisticated AI tools accessible and easy to use for non-experts, without requiring them to master complex prompts and query syntax.

## What It Does
![What it does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aitrailblazer/asap/main/img/ASAP-Screenshot-01.png)
Imagine an AI that can generate code and documentation in minutes, find the information you need in seconds, and publish reports almost instantaneously! ASAP offers a suite of AI copilots transforming tech documentation and code creation using custom ontologies tailored to an organization's standards. Integrating advanced natural language search and automation within a unified workspace, ASAP combines the speed and efficiency of AI with the reliability of traditional systems.

### ASAP's Suite Includes:

- **OntologyGen:** Creates custom ontologies aligned with organizational standards, terminologies, and data structures, ensuring adherence during the document and code generation processes.
- **TechDocGen:** Uses OntologyGen's customized ontologies to generate professional, consistent documentation.
- **CodeGen:** Deploys software ontologies to generate accurate code across multiple platforms, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.
- **ReportGen:** Employs predefined ontologies to create comprehensive, standardized reports in various formats (PDF, diagrams, images).
- **Natural Language Queries:** Enables users to perform precise data searches using natural language, with data stored in a vectorized format in Cosmos DB.
- **Unified Workspace:** Designed for accessibility and ease of use, each AI copilot has its workspace with chat sessions stored for later retrieval using semantic search.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhances performance in knowledge-intensive tasks by retrieving and incorporating external information into prompts.

Each copilot is a domain expert: TechDocGen for documentation, CodeGen for coding languages and platforms. ASAP's customizable settings, such as target audience and response attributes, enable replication of the original chat context. Lifelong Learning Agents, supported by Cosmos DB and vectorization, ensure continuous improvement in performance.

## Problem
![Problem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aitrailblazer/asap/main/img/ASAP-Screenshot-02.png)
Here are the key problems that ASAP addresses:

- **Time Consumption:** Coding and creating software documentation are extremely time-consuming. The vast amount of data developers need to sift through makes managing, organizing, and retrieving relevant information a challenge, leading to information overload and inefficiency.
- **Lack of Consistency:** Without a structured ontology, terms and processes might be used inconsistently across different documents, leading to confusion and misinterpretation. Collaboration across teams or departments can be hindered due to varying interpretations.
- **Inefficiencies in Document and Code Management:** Traditional methods of creating and retrieving documents and code are often time-consuming and labor-intensive.
- **Limited Data Accessibility:** Accessing and retrieving vast amounts of corporate data can be cumbersome and inefficient with conventional systems.
- **Reduced Productivity:** Manual document and code generation can detract from more critical tasks, lowering overall productivity.
- **Lack of Expertise and Customization:** Users often lack the tools to customize outputs or harness expert-level insights in their fields, particularly in non-technical domains.
- **Static Performance:** Many platforms do not adapt or improve over time, failing to learn from interactions or integrate new data effectively.
- **Handling Complex Knowledge:** Traditional platforms struggle with managing and utilizing complex, knowledge-intensive information efficiently.

These pain points collectively reduce development speed and cause frustration within teams, making the search for effective solutions a critical concern for software organizations.

**Consultant’s Journey with ASAP: Optimizing Workflow with Azure Cosmos DB**

John, a seasoned Azure Cosmos DB consultant, received an inquiry from a prospective customer about developing an application utilizing Cosmos DB. Following their conversation, John compiled the customer's requirements and sent them via email, not only to the customer but also as a record for himself.

Juggling multiple clients, John relies on ASAP to streamline his workflow. He opens ASAP and clicks on the Microsoft Graph tab. Using the advanced search capabilities, he locates his emails containing the requirements. By vectorizing these emails, John ensures that he won’t need to resubmit them to GPT every time; ASAP combines the system prompt with the custom prompt for seamless future reference.

With the requirements entered into the database and vectorized, John turns his attention to documentation. He accesses his internal company documents via the OneDrive interface within the Microsoft Graph tab and opens an unstructured document. Using OntologyGen, he customizes settings to create a structured ontology, storing the generated documentation in Azure Cosmos DB in vectorized form for efficient retrieval through Semantic Search.

Next, John leverages DocGen to utilize the vectorized requirements and his custom ontology. The ontology follows a structured format of chapters and sections. Starting with one chapter, John configures DocGen to refine the output iteratively within a chat thread. Once satisfied with a section, he saves the final version.

After completing each section as final and ensuring all chapters are ready, John previews the entire document and makes necessary adjustments. Satisfied with the results, he uses ASAP to generate the final document as a PDF, fully optimized for his customer’s needs.
